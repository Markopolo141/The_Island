# The_Island
Simple console ANSI adventure

# How-To

simply run the makefile

the makefile will call gcc (if it's installed) and only relies apon the C standard libraries.
execute the game in a terminal which supports ANSI escape-codes, and preferably supports extended-ascii (>127) characters for best results.
have fun :-)
